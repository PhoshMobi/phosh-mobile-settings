/**
 * MsTweaksBackendInterface:
 * @parent_iface: The parent interface.
 * @get_value: Get the "value" of the backend. This does not necessarily correspond to any
 *             particular property but rather some value derived from the properties given to the
 *             backend in its constructor.
 * @set_value: Same as `get_value ()`, except it sets the value based on the same principles.
 * @get_setting_data: Should return the instance of `MsTweaksSetting` that was provided in the
 *                    backend's constructor.
 * @get_key: Should return the `key` property of the backend in string format as opposed to the
 *           `GPtrArray` format it originally is in. Generally, this would be achieved by the
 *           backend picking one key that it is going to use out of the ones specified. However, the
 *           string representation may also include other transformations, such as expanding tildes
 *           into full home directory paths.
 *
 * All virtual functions but `set_source_ext ()` need to be implemented by backends. Additionally,
 * backends should generally follow these principles:
 *
 * - Only duplicate properties from the setting data if you want to have it mutable or change the
 *   value somehow, e.g. turning `key` into a `char *` instead of a `GPtrArray`.
 * - Return a MsTweaksBackend from the new () function, not the child type.
